## Used software
#### 2018/01/29 GuntherVD
Here i will list the software i used in the guides found on my webpages.

### Archlinux
This is the distribution of Linux i use. All the commands i use in the guides will be matching Archlinux.
For your ease is tould be great to run the same distribution. Be warned! Archlinux is not for the Linux beginner.
You will need some expierinece to install Archlinux. On the other hand...
If you manage to install Archlinux using the well documented Wiki provided by Archlinux, you have learned alot about linux where the Ubuntu user for example miss allot of linux basics.
