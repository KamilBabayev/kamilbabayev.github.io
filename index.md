## Welcome on my page.
Hi, i am gunther.

Im a Electronics hobyist with interest for Linux. I write this page for my own refference but im sure it will be usefull for other people aswell. I use [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) myself but im pretty sure most of the commands are similar. There are some exeptions though. For example when i write:

`sudo pacman -S foo`

and you are using ubuntu you will need to translate this as:

`sudo apt-get install foo`

My main language is Dutch so if you see errors in my writing, feel free to send me a message then i will correct it.

Have alot of fun,
Gunther,
