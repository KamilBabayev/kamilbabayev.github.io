#### An Introduction to Programming in Go Book

How to read .go program.

```
package main
```
This is known as package declaration. Every go program must have package declaration. Packages are go's way of organizing and reusing code. There are two types of go programs: executables(we run directly) and libraries(package together to use in other programs, like include or python imports.)

Blank lines are ignored by go.

import "fmt"   - this is the way we import code from other packages to use inside our program.

The line starts with // is known as comment. Go also supports /**/ type comments. Everythin between ** is considered comment. This is used mostly for multiline comments.

This part is function declaration.
```
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

All functions start with keywork func followed by name of function(main in this case), a list of zero or more "parameters" surrounded by parentheses, an optional return type and body which is surrounded by curly braces.
 The main function is special because that gets called when we run program.

```
fmt.Println("Hello World")
```
If we get details of this line.  fmt is package name, Println is function inside fmt, 'Hellow World' is a argument which we pass to Println function.

We can also get more details about Println function by
```
do doc fmt                  # shows all functions inside fmt package
go doc fmt Println          # shows info about Println func
```

### **Types**

Data types categorize a set of related values, describe the operations that can be done on them and define the way they are stored. Go is a *statically* typed language, variables always have specific types and types can not be change. Go has several built in data types.

#### Numbers
We split numbers in two different kinds: integers and float-point numbers.
Interegs are numbers without a decimal component.
GO's integer types are: `uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int8, int16, int32, int64`.  8,16,32,64 - tells us how many bits each of this types use.
uint - unsigned integer, unsigned integers only contain positive numbers(or zero)
int  - signed integer 

In addition there are two alias types: `byte` - which is same as `uint8` and `rune` which is same as `int32` (1 byte = 8 bits)
