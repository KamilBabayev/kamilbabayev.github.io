K-drama reviews I wrote while watching them...

## While you were sleeping
‌U can't underestimate the number of mistakes u've avoided making by speaking less: A lesson from While you were sleeping ep 7

## I can hear ur voice
‌finished watching : i can hear ur voice : 20 sep, wow what a confidence the young ladies carry! N the willpower to do the right, to find the spark in complete darkness, Loved it. The nok jhok relationship of all & the emotion se goli maare attitude of Attorney Cha. Learnt a very important lesson of not to hate anyone in any adverserial situations bcoz it's easy blaming them, not knowing their whole story, instead pity them and move on; for a happy life is one u spent loving others & a lifeless life one resenting others.
