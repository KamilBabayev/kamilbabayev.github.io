## 23 dec: 
until u accept, acknowledge & appreciate ur own uniqueness, u will keep feeling anxious..... N unable to experience that joy, satisfaction of appreciating others' joys & successes & owns.. & to give & serve the world in real sense. Also, believe that the magic u can create can be limited to ur domain & u need not be an expert in other common fields but remember that makes u unique, also giving u chances to learn a very different way & always an option to up ur learning curve. 
‌
## 1 dec: 
To Maddy sir: i believe I can start by making small changes & a gradual incorporation.... & also believe in the value provided by mentorship by you & other dignitaries. It'll help me discover & strengthen unique aspects of my personality. Also, to kinda shift my perception of I'm not a marketing person to somewhat like I'm a people's person & thus could influentially sell a few things, slid in recommendations of quality products. <br>
‌i pondered over the thought of you having said that one needs to find a goal, I did & i really want to make it true, turn that picturesque scenery of travel locations a reality for my family, parents & li'll brother. S, r u willing to invest that much time, until I suceed in amounting / collecting a XYZ Amount. <br>

## 10 dec: 
tanays video 1 & wootech ka start karo.... 21 days to build the good habit

## 23 nov: 
no one would ever know how much I have cried everyday, hurting myself & cursing before I actually become successful. 
‌
## 22 Nov: 
I started with Python for huge reasons, ended up loving it for small reasons, the quickness to reach a soln for a problem, to simplify & make others understand, to do my daily tasks, like fetching questions from interview bit, automate or do the repetitive boring tasks, could be renaming a batch of documents, zipping, excel edits & so much. <br>
‌watching bad genius ep 11 : This show still gives me chills. Although I really wished agar itna dimaag aur planning kuchh achha karne lagaayi hoti, toh duniya kitni positively impact hoti. The things I learnt is real situations are unpredictable, no matter how many times u try to simulate neither u can enliven the exact past moment or perfectly plan future. Every moment is unique. Live in present. <br>
‌also, a ray of hope that there's always a way out of every problem u encounter, either end up excusing or be on the tip of toes to face it <br>

## ‌21 Nov: 
Tell Me I Love You: A sweet little hour & a quarter movie. Light fun ending on a note: These are my guys, pretty li'll messed family, whom I wouldn't trade for anything else in the world
‌
## 18 nov: 
ep 9 tale of nine-tailed : don't get feared by the fear, for beyond them, lies the real world! 
‌
## 17 nov: 
new year. Startup ep 10; let us all not be each others pride bcoz we need to bear the unnecessary burden of expectations. Be self-appreciating instead. Simplified relationships advice. White lies hurt others too. 
‌
## 15 nov: 
LinkedIn in post whotech summit debug 2020 acceptance 

## 16 nov: 
startup tips- analyse risks as possibilities of loss & opportunities to outshine. 
‌that one stroke of wind which u feel is luck, for the moment , the one that gives you a shortcut to something against ur principles might take ur growth five year down the line, affecting ur conscience, confidence, self-esteem & self- appraisal qualities. <br>
‌be proactive, practise meticulous presence of mind every moment to convey best of ur intentions.<br> 
‌take criticism as finding a way to improve. <br>
‌if a leader out of humility says I'm good for nothing, what does it make his employees? Super dumb? So, never self - reject  or pull urself down on words when leading even if u have best of intentions. <br>
‌sometimes things that start a weird way, unlikely to have any ansh (trace) of progressing further, end up impressing u. 
‌<br>

## 9 nov: 
sincerity shows! Sme interview at LTI, kai deadline hoy toh maaru dimaag 100x par chaale, info absorb karwa, bas a energy waste nhi karwaani, unclear paani ne settle thava dai ne a shaanti ni use kari potential energy ne greatness no stambh banaavaano. <br>

‌Start up kdrama Ep 8: i cried my heart out today, main je pan moments jyotsna baa jode miss karya, a badha aasun padi ne baar chhalki gya, seo dal mi & grand ma na moments joi ne, ek toh visually impaired ni help, start up na struggles, life ma low point ne challenge consider kari ne overcome karvu, infact opportunity banai devi, & handwriting t insaan saathe nu  connection, badha touching topics! <br>

## 8 nov: 
start up : episode 7: paiso k peeche kitna bhi bhaag lo, par passion & purpose k peeche bhaagne se jo khushi milti h wah kabhi nhi milegi, in the end people, real emotions & moments felt r all that we take away with us. & we leave behind all those lives touched, wllel propelled them to an enlightened path we feel which is. <br>

LTI Update: ‌its almost a week later the codility - the day of retest, i didn't prepare this time as well, infact even before exam I was helping a student pass his java oops exam, a random stranger on Telegram, but then what made me pass codility with 100% this time, what were the changes in my approach : less overconfidence, & positive mindset, determined to achieve good results however trying brute force or whatever approach needed to pass that programming test. <br>

‌One lesson of the day: 
- let randomness vreate its magic. Aaj hi color ka kaam khatam hua, ek imp cheez t, texture decide karna, we choose lot many intricate detailed designs but somehow they seemed too much wall-paperish or too difficult for Painter uncle (manish) to draw so, eventually ended to go forward with a randomly picked design & it turned out to be so well, matching with roof lights, and creating the 'per-fekt maahol, pure co-incidence turning out good, <br> 
i guess kiss principle - keep it simple stupid, works while making decisions / choices too! <br>


## 7 nov: 
selected as wootech mentor, don't know which doors would it open, randomness kahin b le jaa sakti h,

‌
## 20 oct: 
love is sweet ep 10: I know its painful to go against the flow of river current, but unless u try it how will u know ur real self! 

## 1 nov: 
started watching start up! 
‌
## 2nd nov: 
almost all failures in my life had come with a definite purpose to make me humbler in the sense less over-confident, in the root shaking my entirety making that one degree /little positive deviation leading or rather pushing me towards the better path. <br>
One such shock, leaving aside the technical issue excuse was, failing in Codility, although it was a challenging 2 hr session, which kinda tested my patience and response to noise & other stressful situations, it did shook my mentality that I was far ahead the league of other fresher LTIians in terms of DSA, project & portfolio. The pride fell, uncovering a deeper, truer level & layer of mine.<br>
A master is one who keeps practicing. Levels of intelligence overturn with constant efforts. <br>

## 21 oct :
Turn all ur embarrassing experiences into worth to remember ones by embracing them. <br> 
Life becomes much simpler when we do this. Being attentive & giving equal importance to all activities u r presently doing is the only way out from a regretful past & bright future. <br> 
‌value urself, rest everything falls in place automatically. <br> 
‌my tears have been the doorway for all my strong feelings I've ever had. ‌<br> 
‌
## 10 oct: 
Started watching social dilemma! Awestruck by the impact of technologies & software products on our minds. 
Well truly saying I appreciated ML, DL & all those tech so much that I keep glaring at every new updates, was too involved could say. <br> 
But as soon as the documentary Brought into limelight the vast control levers of the world in the hands of machines, it really made me think/ pondering. <br> 
It's quite shakening, nerve wrecking & certainly makes me detached from social media. It definitely changed my perspective on tech & made me interested in making actually user assisting tech (less addictive & engaging) ( considering his / her long term benefits) coin side. <br> 
Apps like: book something & app automatically closes, if u want to buy other things click open the app... Basically less recommendations & only necessary interaction. <br> 

## 11 oct:

## 12 oct :
Success, in large part, is about overcoming your biggest enemies - that's usually not your boss or your lack of opportunities - it's your fears and insecurities.
‌
## 28 sep:
‌fight for my way lessons <br>
‌dont ever be too proud of urself thinking that have fooled someone by impostering, they always know, coz ppl have an unexplained sense of real. <br>
‌even a master loses with beginners when he doesn't train /practise. <br>
‌the slowly built relations are always stronger than the instant infatuations. <br>

‌ep 8 ": when choi ae ra says they work hard, see dim days struggle so much but their resume will still be empty when compared to privileged kids who get healthy environment, abroad studies and more, that lines just hit the heart at right place, making one aware of & relate to struggles of people who later become champions. 

## 6 oct:  
The reason y ur father might not be walking at ur pace is to get u good things, so teary eyed rn. He's the first one wanting you to see u fly high & live a life better than him. <br>
He's bore a burden to take care of all hr needs by stopping to live his life his way. Never hurt him, ask him what was his dream, & do whatever close to it u can, bcoz he wasn't always ur dad, u weren't always his dreams; he had sacrificed all his previous dreams for u & comfort of ur family. <br>
A little token of appreciation could bring him a lifetime joy, don't mis the chance to do this when u can, before it becomes impossible & irrelevant <br>
‌if dreams are supposed to be that great always, what would a non- challant do w/o being passionate, he might have spent years earning real money to meet needs that he somehow forgot how to dream <br>
Ep 14: every storm in the world finds u when u have ur guard down. <br>
‌once the storm goes away, then the darkness comes, this is the game-changing period wherein a person is given a new chance to start over with the failed experience, to correct it & go to unimaginable lengths, the graph really could be a parabola here! <br>

## 12 oct: 
dong man : if we can't win, let's play anyway, living our life own way (the way we want) is winning too <br>
‌sul hee: u need to be reckless to hit a jackpot <br>
‌joo man : don't mind what others are eating. <br>
‌choe ae ra: where I am is the major league. <br>

## ‌9 oct: 
Today I spent 5+ hrs making a bday card for my sis' fiancee, i.e. my Jiju H, initially I felt excited as we'd together be making something, & afterall it's my hobby, long lost love of doing crafts. <br>
But in the process, my sis caught up with some urgent office work when a few thoughts popped up in my mind, I didn't want to, but they were involuntary! The thought that Maasi kept saying that my sis' bsy & she has loads of work to do as the company pays off well. <br>
 I'm not a promoter of working hard though it hurt, does she think I was too much free? I literally had cancelled all my plans for the day (okay not the complete day, but u know the productivity of programmers at evening/night right?), so what was I saying, ya my schedule which was: <br>
‌solving hackfest 2020, Work on covid vaccine prediction project, my freelance content writing, the analatics vidhya blog for competition & the daily commitments of Coursera's full stack course, Java course & lti assignments! Basically what I meant to say is I was bsy. <br>
‌so, as usual overthinking happened & I went like why? Why would I have break my schedule & come here when I doubt they would even do the same for me, look I've got appreciated in my life a lot, but no one ever did care / at least show that level of readiness to spend that much time for me.... But, then counterstrike of thoughts happened : I thought & went there bcoz I liked doing it, & wanted to help & I'm doing that so y regret? Then, I thought how at each second they were taking care of me, & even told me to stop doing it if I feel a bit of bored/exhausted .... <br>
‌Thats when I realised things that went wrong which I should have corrected :<br>
‌let people know ur situation, before blindly giving it all & expecting to hear from them abt how u prioritised them above others <br>
‌learn to say no <br>
I actually learnt how it feels being victim of superficial helper ( which I have been many a times), where we have the good intentions but our actions doesn't speak so. I'll stop being one now.

## 4 oct:
i need to vent it out! <br>
‌tuti hu par nirkhi hu: life main yeh toh pakka pata chal gya, all fast paced things rnt good, be it any relationship or book or course. <br>
‌kisise sirf 2 din main attach nhi hona chahiye, one might be showing his superficial side. Masquerading original intentions which is very likely to happen in real world! <br>
‌to save urself from this always look on the indicators! Every strategy has a mistake made, be smart enough to detect it. With this the start of a good thing is likely to be not so exciting and kinda dull, but that's where u could see through & identify real. <br>
‌take admiration & quick success with a pinch of salt of it being purely due to luck or down the garage <br>
