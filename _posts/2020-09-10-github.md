My encounter with github in Short




{% raw %}
## Yeh kya khazaana h?

suffer to safar with Github & open source: 3 baar mili hu hu main isse, <br>
‚Äå
## the first time 
w/o even knowing what it is to find & use it as a collection of code for our Android project in feature huntüòÇ, thinking there's no chance we could contribute to this platform.. I didn't like it as had the perception that git is all for chori (copy-pasting) for small developers & glory for senior, super talented devs.  <br>


## ‚Äåthe second time:
I came in vicinity of git is during lockdown when I wanted to keep track of my daily learnings, actually this time I really acknowledged the beauty of it, as I understood what actually a Version Control System - vcs meant! <br>
But yet there was much to learn abt how to present it nicely, knowing norms..  <br>

This second phase I used it more like a file system used for remote backup..  <br>

Or like a google doc, basically to push all the programs I coded for & different wise soln I came across, much during daily leetcoding & interviewbit phase  <br>

## ‚Äåthe third encounter 
this is when I loved it truly, became one with it, <br>

‚Äåbe it advanced commands or the logic behind them, I slowly got to learn n actually got a lotta attention too, which I likeüòÅ,<br>
that one push by contributers in my repo, or me learning yet new things <br>
& knowing how approachable the big tasks were, was much fascinating, <br>
still peeling its wonders layer by layer...<br>

## Final Thoughts
Now, thinking abt the old days, I regret not learning it before, <br>
btw, did I tell u the story how we used to transfer an entire android project folder by folder meeting all the space constraints handling that confusion, <br>
also the kasht (much efforts) to do zipping n all then not being able to transfer exe files via gmail & hence discovering wetransfer! <br>
All that üìÇ My story is this, what's urs? 


## Sayonara

Meet u again!
