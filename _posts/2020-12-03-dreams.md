Current Goals - 2020




{% raw %}
## Hi there!

Today someone on LinkedIn asked me what are ,y goals or what i dream to do in near future?<br>

Wow, that question just made me think about it even more. So, here's what I have in mind, although this goal alters everyday.. <br>

There's so much I want to explore, <br>

### First Phase:
now being a fresher, with that high energy, less responsibilities, I definitely want to live all experiences, esp. Tech fields, being as observant as I can, figuring out what's happening in the bigger picture; definitely involving hustle & discovering interests.<br>

### Second Phase:
& perhaps after a few years dive into sorta entrepreneurial journey, where I could leverage all that I learnt before & share what I consumed.( Might be taking a hobby/ side project I invested in earlier, to implement it to larger level & serve a unique purpose) <br>

### Third phase:
It's a bit of blurry, unplanned, beautiful venture of me being financially independent & wandering around & penning it all down, to may be pass on the legacy..<br>

Ahaa, I'm already flowing on dreams. <br>
