Jotted points for blogs

```
‌get involved with locals

‌local cottages over 5 stars - more close to learning the real life and people there
‌community engagement over spas - know the cultural aspects & broaden ones views
‌prefer local guide over tourist guide/ packages
‌explore local cuisines- local food over regular hotel food
‌know their speciality, their unique challenges, n ideas to overcome them to actually become part of the place and gain invaluable knowledge & skills. Feel closer, experience true bond, make connections for life, extend your family. Enjoy being one with nature.
‌embrace uncertainties and surprises instead of fix plans. - get prepared for best & worst
```

Tomorrow is such an illusionary dream we all weave with wool( moments) of our life.

Bcoz, we can't even plan our next minute, how come r the manifestations of Sheikhchilli even justified. 

We can't manage time, but surely can manage our actions during it. Period.

Physical significance : At different life stages our body radiates / reverberates different amount of energy. That energy exuded is directly proportional to the impact which an experience will have on us. Simply put, same incident happening can have different response in cases of different timezone, people & the circumstances they are dealing with at that present time
