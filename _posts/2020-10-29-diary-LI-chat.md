Some LI chats / Journal Entries for Oct 2020




## 29th oct:
Taking the initiative always pays! That extra 10-20 minutes u take out to reach out to new( out of ur network) people. One such meeting I had with Cristina a few weeks back. <br>
I learned so much. & today she shared mentioning me on her  LinkedIn post which opened new opportunities for me as I got to connect to people of different stratas & domains which I otherwise wouldn't have explored much. I am thankful to her & myself to take that time to exchange ideas & form a real connection. 

## 30th oct: 
Gunreet reached out to me yesterday after seeing Cristina's post & asked for a few tips & advice & mind it who doesn't like to spill the beans, I shared my learnings, she appreciated it (I know it shouldn't, but this is the reason I spend my time writing that long advice / my experience post for people, that heartfelt thank yous keep me going, actually not even thank yous but the feeling of having touched someone's life, being of little help to them. I like it, which is why I have connected & helped a bunch of folks, who reached out via Telegram id. ) <br>
Moreover in the process, while prepping for call - I find how much I already know & that gives me confidence to go ahead & that bliss & reaffirmation of being on the right path<br>
In the actual call - while narrating about my life & me, I always realise a few new facts about me, which helps me know myself better.<br><br>

The thousand good thoughts I have in my head are no worth if that doesn't impact someone, by my actions or words. <br>
So, always share what u learn, what u think & why u think. - > this points me a step ahead to the thought of creating my YouTube channel, to help people avoid the mistakes I made & share wiser paths, nope at least to ease their lives :) 

## Good Products Definition : 
1. Gives a user soln - Isn't it all the successful products are ones which initially were intended to make the the user/consumer's life easy. (Btw, same applies to a person's success too - > Help someone & u automatically get Uplifted & get success.) 
2. Better branding - In terms of image building, like xerox - > Photocopy, Colgate - > toothpaste
3. Genuinity - Trust is an important factor whether be it forming deeper relationships or even buying smallest of products. ( Cheap & trendy things have a chance of fading soon, but ones which are actually trustable, go a long way).
