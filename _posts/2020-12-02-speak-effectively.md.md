## A cheatsheet to effective speech / talk. 

Hello guys, a very good morning to you all. This is about something I wanted to share with you all & don't worry it won't take any longer than 6 minutes & <br>
this is kinda cheat sheet that I formulated based on my learnings through an interesting MIT lecture by prof...patrick winston..& also all our sessions so far. <br>
So, r u guys excited to save ur time ten folds- i. E. A 60"minute lecture & 6 + hrs content summarized in 6 minutes.<br>
So, without further ado let's get started.<br>
The topic as you'll comprehend by seeing the title is to mind plot a cheat sheet for points to remember before, during & after a talk..mostly relevant for formal settings <br>

### Let's start with the start!
What r prerequisites before the Start? Go with prior knowledge on the topic ure speaking about( which basically means researching well beforehand), practise it & the energy u bring. U might be wondering about its correlation with the topic, but yes knowing The order of importance of those factors has many advantages, <br>

 your knowledge, ur execution (which depends on practice) & a small factor the innate talent (could be shown by passion as well) <br>

So, pondering on this.. all those reasons of not being an extrovert / being communicative fade away right? <br>

#### The beginning
The beginning as people suggest, should be a joke right? No, then a heavy life philosophy right? No. Why? Bcoz in the beginning, people are just settling in, if it was physical setup they might be adjusting their chairs, opening notepads, sipping water, etc... So, then what? The attention catcher should be the value u're going to provide. Best is:  honestly convey it & people will connect.<br>

Well now after planning a good start:<br>
How the other contents should be? The flow.. <br>

#### The flow
For this, There are certain techniques which will definitely help your audience to retain & best understand what ure saying. <br>
First is : circling which basically means Repeating. Why do we need this? <br>
Bcoz at any given point of time, more than 60% people are zoned out.. Its not their fault but a human tendency to being distracted. So, repeat ur stuff, atleast the important points so that, it becomes easy for your audiences to be on track even after being lost for a moment or more. Here & then<br>

Next is: 

#### Draw a fence
Draw a fence around ur topic, that is eliminate obvious confusions beforehand. <br>
& then there are other factors like : 
#### Right Pace, place, props & time.
By these i wanna indicate:<br>
- Try to prefer/ have a supportive environment
- For pace would mean u should deliver content at moderate speeds.
- Place why does it matter? Bcoz no one likes to hear lectures in dim lights of theatre right? Also, it's obviously conducive for sleeping.
- Then the time, that I wouldn't like to address you all at 2 am right, also not 3 pm when u r likely to feel dizzy.
- Ponder over ur props bcoz they kinda leave a great impact. People remember unique things from any events right, the big fat wedding cake, or the illuminated stage, the rose waala example we saw in Dananjaya's video.
#### Interaction
Also, to make it bidirectional, interactive, ask questions! Also, one thing to note is wait for no longer than 7 seconds, bciz then it turns to awkward silence. 

### Ending
Which brings me to the ending of the slides: <br>
Lastly, I would like to end with how to end. Now, put all ur creativity horses at run. Joke around! To make ur last impression as being funny, humorous<br>

like actually <br>
hypnotizing people into believing that they had a great time with u.<br>

& rest of the points are self explanatory giving a good summary & calling out to action & clear doubts of audience by having QnA.<br>

Thank you for patiently listening so far!<br>


### Other Points:
.. speak effectively, here the word effectively stresses more about how u expect / want it go. / bring u desired results. N this is relevant for all business talks, although not so much for informal ones.
but to calm those anxious nerves before a speech, this is much effective. <br>

- Knowledge >practice > talent 
- ‌Start with a promise, not a joke.(since people r juz settling, not ready for joke & get comfortable so quickly, instead in starting minutes they decide whether its worth paying attention, so u might as well want to let them know the objective / benefit of the session) 
- ‌circle(repeat required due to human tendencies of distraction) 
- ‌build a fence around the idea (which u wanna convey, since others might confuse it for something else)
- ‌verbal punctuation (like the right amount of pause at right place - eg: let's eat man) 
- ‌ask a question (don't wait for eternity, a good time will be 7 seconds) 
‌- end with joke- (like while giving question bank a teacher marks all the questions important, likewise, I'll recommend you all to check the video too)
