## 20 July:
Came across Udaan movie, esp. Songm Aazadiyaan, pata nhi q, aasu rukne ka naam nhi le rhe they, tab I realised the fact that everyone gonna be great person main ek cheez common hoti h, the wish to help someone else, disregarding the fact they could be ehsaan faramosh, the ones even the ones opposing u;

## 25 July: 
watched Random Chikibum lives on interviews n exams, I literally cried outta happiness & it was a complete healthy and hearty laugh hearing all those relatable incidents n experiences and moreover it came as a piece to ease my inner anti-calmness due to PSOC presentation, diving deep into what PSOC presentation was, I was literally going through phases, like a day before actual presentation ( 25) i. E. Yesterday, I made Teams  Page, also at around 2am I wrote my presentation points to cover for me as well as the whole team, environment was surreal & my confidence raised to peak. I was so happy that I was eventually able to pull out the speech structure in such less time into meaningful parts, well structured and organised. I woke up happy with a relief of content like arey aaj ko present karna h woh toh already ready h, plus virtual meeting h toh already less nervousness, n since yeh part toh maine khud hi likha h, I'll be able to explain it all even w/o having to take one more look. <br>
Was good until I saw one of my team mates msg, that since other elements aren't ready yet, already created cheezo ko hi aur presentable banana h, which actually needed a few modifications in the code I sent earlier. Ab baje they 10.20   when I saw the msg fir mom ko help bhi karni t, n chahiye tha kaam ready 11 tak! Omg, achanak se unwanted pressure build ho gya. I think u could relate it well with thinking about all those unplanned things, majorly problems that haunt u suddenly outta blue. <br>
Jab I was working on modifications, Fir realize kiya, problem sirf yeh nhi h, laptop doesn't WiFi n/w, yeh bhi h toh zoom meet connect kaise karungi, phone main zoom k glitch h, can't update bcoz of insufficient space. Everything boiled down to more problems. <br>
I didn't how to calm my heart, but jo b bolo team bahut supportive & understanding t, coz hum log ne presentation se pehle internal meeting ki tab everyone quickly understood my points, kaafi satisfaction mila, I could lead my team n make 'em prepared at last moments. <br>
Yet kismat meri Jethalal ko takkar de usse kam nhi, I actually was prepared  after handling those unexpected events that popped out of nowhere. <br>
Tab meeting start hui, jo present karne waala tha ppt woh gaayab ab karu toh kya, last minute panic attacks, thik h thodi der main we managed to present it. <br>
But woh ek flow, calmness shattered, uske baad hyper hona hi h, toh thoda speed main instability, kuchh jagah pe kaafi fast, n kuchh pe a. A. A. A. Karke atakna. Somehow it turned like this link:<br>

Finally presentation done, looking back things I learnt from this incident <br>

Always have plan B<br>
Be ready to accept the unexpected <br>
Calm urself down, roz ki practice <br>
Kuchh b cheez itni badi nhi hoti, k tum baaki sab bhool k uske peeche pad jaao. <br>




## 27 june:
Completed watching Cheese in the trap, was well crafted piece, revealing true colors, hidden feelings of a character & how everyone has reason to do something bad; quite uninteresting ending though. 

## 31 july: 
- watching love alarm and go go squid again. 
- Re-living the joy of writing the book, may its the fruiting time for all the efforts, got 1k + downloads on Google playbooks & 4.8 star rating, n what's more unbelievable is all that views are organic, that means of strangers whom we didn't speak about to. 
- Regarding close friends I never officially sent them the link to it ðŸ¤£, idk it seems like there's much more left to do before being that proud. Will keep trying. Even though not immediately efforts are rewarded ultimately. 

- Today's joke n quote, when yaya was consoling Tong Nian not to cry or feel said & stated how that is merely a chemical cycle, once more oxytocin is produced Tong Nian may feel no sadness n come to normal life, like we r reborn with every bio chemical cycle. To which our smart Nian Nian replied, cardaic cells rnt reborn! Now, Yaya knows a straight A+ student can't even be consoled! 

## 2 aug: 
how much time did I spend for getting HTML, CSS, REACT right for modal & then popover component of profiles of Team for PSOC ðŸ˜µ UI UX bhi traas h! I actually now think it's not that easy to deal with as I thought, rather a test of patience, in which who continually tries & puts in efforts & trial & errors win! To be best efforts r reqd in every field. <br>

5 aug: started watching descendants of sun. Understood how a doctors decision matters, how his /her confidence is crucial at times, also this momentary yet impactful decision is result of years of his experience, every case he's handled n every possible thing learnt. Also, how don't I say abt patroitism, humanity and politics, so intertwined! Personal obligations and morals are most important. <br>

## 7th aug :

## 29 june: 
I got msg that I could publish my medium article with Faun Community, today I was bsy researching ideas & selecting projects for gsod, for not than a lakh times I thought why didn't I get aware of such cool projects before? May be I could have helped my parents with the stipend, I could've have developed fine skills earlier then also would have discovered the magic before kinda wasting 4 yrs, spent with making no contributions to the society with my knowledge / learnings. <br>
So, I have decided to help as much people esp. Students possible to not make the same mistake. Even if my initiative helps a few I would feel great to be of some help to them. <br>
BTW, being in this thoughts blaming myself, I became much restless today, nature saved me this time. It started raining heavily & I went to terrace with family.  <br>
Experiencing those cool watershots on head I realized gow stupid I am to keep regretting my present now. Cried out my heart. Grew stronger & with hopes resparked I came home. :) Now, I realise why worklife balance needs to be maintained

## Self- Note:
Hi Aastha, don't ever forget the sense of achievement u get by doing something, learning it, completing a task or get that done for future motivation, save it for referring in future. This is what makes u real happy in life.<br> To know things, discover perspectives, imbibe the unimagined & unexpected, this is what u enjoy!<br>
So, keep doing them irrespective of whether they cause u materialistic achievements or not.
