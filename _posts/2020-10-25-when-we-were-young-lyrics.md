Awesome Lyrics of 'People don't hurt young people' & 'fourth floor of north'




{% raw %}
## People don't hurt young people lyrics

```
The clarity leaps on both eyes,
Dont let the answer tie you up, 
Strong winds lose to our strong dreams, 
Even though our shirts are wrinkled we put on with bravery & struggle, 
Our youth's overflowing ideas
Laugh all night & suddenly become sad all night. 

```

## Fourth floor of north
P.S. : I love the music, it's calming to a different level.



## Sayonara

Meet u again!
