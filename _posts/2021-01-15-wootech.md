## Presentation on 15 jan

### Intro:
Hello everyone, Greetings of the day. Great to see such interesting projects & moreover meeting such enthusiastic people here. <br>
So, I'll start by telling yall a bit abt myself, the project & team. I'm Aastha Mehta, a 2020 EXTC grad, now working as a Full Stack Engineer GET at LTI, previously interned as a ML Intern at CloudCounselage. I'm passionate about software & tech in general & love sharing my learnings & so been a mentor at PSOC, an open source program & Girlscript's Uplift.  <br>
My journey in IT has been significantly unique from basic Arduino programming to MATLAB, to Image Processing, ML /AI, Neural networks & Web Tech. <br>
Basically, having touched them all, & with exploring all these, I have formulated various ways of learning, unlearning & relearning..  <br>
& here I'm mentor for atRentals project.  <br>
Talking abt the team, its very diverse.. From nontraditional & complete non tech background to ones who have pretty good grasp on web dev, we have them all.  <br>
Thus, we proceeded with a learn & build approach.  <br>
The project named atRentals is aimed ro be a book renting site, well no surprises, where one can come & either put a book on rent or buy it on rent. Thus, a transparent platform for exchange. Simple yet scalable in terms of functionality was the primary goal.  <br>
Where we initially work on goals, of buying sharing, filtering avl books.. As per dates they are put for rent on..  <br>
& others like search by category, author, etc features. Scope is integrating payments,... We're trying to explore all this while we first discuss concepts & apply them.  <br>
Next, Shubha, Pearline, Kusum... Will introduce themselves.  <br>


(PS: I wrote this to etch the memory of the event in my mind)
