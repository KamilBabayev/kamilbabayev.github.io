I was selected as a mentor for PSOC for Project: Customizable Portfolio




{% raw %}
## My Thoughts
I was so elated & proud to be selected as this was the first open-source proper proper program that I had been part of<br>
plus the project, i wanted to give it my best.<br>
Also, i considered it as a good playground for my newly sharpened Web dev skills (React from freecodecamp & other cool youtubers (thanks to Amir Sohel for inspiring me to complete this) & adv web tech , but given a chance again to learn it from scratch, I would be first hopping to documentation..)<br>

## Tried to caption the Youtube video below:

(This was abt the mid project presentation we had with other teams)<br>


Hello everyone I am Aastha, mentor of the project Customizable_Portfolio, & my team mates are : Akash, Sarthak & Vidit. <br>

Our project customizable Portfolio, renamed elemento, is to help users make an online portfolio,
Going beyond the traditional 1 pager resume. <br>
It enables u to showcase one's skills in the form of participation in various activities /events, courses, in a presentable way in the form of cards & clickable links.<br>

Sure, One could say if one wants to make a portfolio site, why not Google for already avl code, or may be take from github / any other site providing templates.. <br>
But one thing that isn't allowed by those options is element wise customizability. <br>
Imagine u're choosing from 5-6 designs / templates, & <br>
Let's say u like navbar of design 1 & footer or any other element like cards of design 2, u would have to the tedious task of first decode all the design patterns & their codes, find & map elements & further customise it.. Anyways for a developer its still possible, he might be quick to work on codes, but what aboit beginners/ non - coders? To save all this hassle, we have built Elemento! <br>

So without further ado, we will dive right into the implementation.<br>

### Features Summary 

- currently we r exploring various hosting options avl & would get it deployed & ready for users soon. 
- & future plans include to get most liked/ starred elements or the  recently uploaded ones at the top & automate the procedure of updating team details as & when a user contributes. 

Further we would like to present what technologies are used & how the exact site structure would like & the current state & progress of the project. <br>

This is a project definitely needed to be an open source as more contributions could be benefit the site & add the beauty.  I'll handover to my Team mate Sarthak who'll show demo of the site. - - now. <br>

Hello everyone I am Aastha, mentor of the project Customizable_Portfolio, & my team mates are : Akash, Sarthak & Vidit.

Our project customizable Portfolio, renamed elemento, is to help users make an online portfolio, which has become very much necessary to showcase skills & experience in a very visual way, and to extend the depiction of one's in depth experiences & interests beyond the traditional 1 pager resume in the form of participation in various activities /events, courses, in a presentable way in the form of cards & clickable links.
So without further ado, we will dive right into the implementation plan.
Let's come to the point what exactly r we creating and what's it for.
Just imagine today, rn if someone wants to build a portfolio what will he/she do, well the answer may vary from person to person,but undoubtedly most would prefer to Google some basic templates /go through previously made examples & refer it from there/ copy & modify according to needs. This seems a bit lengthy process & boring too bcoz /also not guaranteeing one may / may not find what he's looking for, or the whole code all at once would be mind boggling to debug for & modify as per needs atleast for beginners. So, in order to resolve this issue, we came up with the idea that y not make a resourceful place/site which has all the basic resources to start with & then any user could tweak as per his requirement(in terms of changing colors/ lets suppose project are shown with card elements & number of cards would vary from person to person & each one would thus have to use perhaps a different styling) . Considering that fact we plan to have site with elements of a basic portfolio(eg: About me section, cards for project, footer with socials) each having atleast five - six variations of that component.
Eg let's think of an About me section of any portfolio the basic thing it should have is an image, name & bio/ more info of a person. Now this itself could have variations in terms of positioning of those elements like image placed above, description below,or vice versa or even image on the left n content on right or so.

Further we would like to present what technologies are used & how the exact site structure would like & the current state & progress of the project. 
This is a project definitely needed to be an open source as more contributions could be benefit the site & add the beauty.  I'll handover to my Team mate Sarthak who'll show demo of the site. - - now. 

Demo
The exact structure of the site goes like this:... 
Work done until now:
- website structure & Frontend 
- Search box, basic back-end functionality 

Technology / Future Milestones and Plans. 
- Creating more example elements
- Hosting
- all in 1 download button 

Benefits : 
- divided into simple basic understandable components, easy for beginners, providing structurally ready code for experienced. 
- provision of live preview
- open source would attract many people to contribute their ideas 
Thank you.

## 14 Aug updates:
```
Status:

I'm ready with 5 cards elements
Vidit's working on Contact form element-  details sending via email 

Testing is still in explore phase:
-I've tested button on clicks basic,  modal button left 
-Akash has snapshot tested navbar, footer

Since testing is taking much time, pausing it now since less time left to deadline & have much broken, incomplete sections in actual site. 

-------------11-11
Let's first get the below things done:

Actual site Priorities:
-restricting elements page content to oauth logged in users only ( for that prompt if not logged in) 
- Element page section division as in portfolio navbars, profile/about me, cards, contact sections
-fixing broken links, Footer issues, adding team/about us content of actual site
- hosting resources, deploying actual website. 

Later:
Download All button functionality( acessing html codes of selected blocks- boolean feature to each modal/ design template uploaded: tag. InnerHTML method ) , Testing 
```
